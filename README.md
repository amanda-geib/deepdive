(.md stands for "markdown documentation)

Three general areas:

(1) [[Buckminster]]

"The most accounted life in history/It started naturally"

Buckminster Fuller is the guy buckey balls were named after, and geodesic domes like the Disney World Epcott park. The point of [[Buckminster]] is to digitize the important points from all my journal entries from 2013-2023.


(2) [[Watchmen]]

 "A circulatory system is seen by the perimeter fence. A few days later, a partially muscled skeleton stands in a hallway and screams for a moment before vanishing."

[[Watchmen"]] refers to a graphic novel series written by Alan Moore and set in America in the 1980's. The point of [[Watchmen]] is to pull data from external, non-self reported sources.

(3) [[Rapture]]

"A man chooses, a slave obeys."
